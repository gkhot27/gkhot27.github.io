    title: "Week 1 of the 'AI Engineer Core Track: LLM Engineering, RAG, QLoRA, Agents' course",
    category: "Learning",
    content: `In Week 1, I explored how large language models like GPT and Llama can be applied to real business use cases such as content creation and technical documentation. I focused on experimenting through prototyping in a notebook environment and improved my prompting skills by building a tool that answers technical questions. The week emphasized learning through experimentation, community collaboration, and set the stage for upcoming challenges like building a brochure generator and a personalized AI tutor.`,

    content: `Experimenting with LLM-powered web scraping. I've built a small tool that takes any URL, scrapes the main content, and uses an LLM to generate a concise one-sentence summary. It's a great way to quickly understand what a page is about without reading the whole thing. Try it out below!`,
